title:  The Symfony Micro-Framework
summary: |
    So you love microframeworks like Silex. Yep - me too. Being able
    to create a single file and immediately code up some routes is awesome.

    But Symfony is a *big* framework, right? *Wrong*! Symfony can be as
    small as a *single* file!

    In this tutorial, we'll bootstrap a project using Symfony as a micro-framework:
    something that looks more like Silex, but with the tools you're used to.
    This means:
    
    * Small: A project structure with *very* few files
    * Simple: Create pages by touching one file
    * Familiar: It's still Symfony :)
    * Powerful: Enable/disable any bundles you need
    * Evolve: Grow from micro to full-sized as your app succeeds

    So if your next project is perfect for a micro-framework, you
    can still use Symfony.
